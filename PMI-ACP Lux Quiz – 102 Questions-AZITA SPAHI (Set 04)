        const questions = [
            { id: 1, text: "During a daily standup meeting, the project manager goes from one team member to another questioning each one on the work they have accomplished and reprimanding them for the slow progress the team made so far. The meeting lasts for almost an hour and turns into a status meeting. What would an agile practitioner recommend to avoid the next standup meeting turning into a status meeting?", options: [
                {text: "A. Use a timer configured to alarm 30 minutes after the start of the meeting", explanation: "Incorrect. While setting an alarm to a predefined interval may help in adhering to one of the ground rules of the daily standup, this action is unlikely to address the main reason the standup turned into a status meeting."},
                {text: "B. Switch the development life cycle from adaptive to predictive", explanation: "Incorrect. Project managers who have traditionally worked in a predictive environment are used to getting status from the team members. Therefore, switching the development life cycle from adaptive to predictive will only reinforce the meeting to become status rather than standup. Additionally, the life cycle is typically not switched in the middle of a project."},
                {text: "C. Have a team member to facilitate the standup instead of the project manager", explanation: "Correct. Agile encourages teams to be self-organizing and self-directing. Having a team member to facilitate the standup instead of the project manager will promote and strengthen this practice."},
                {text: "D. Advise the project manager to only focus on impediments to progress", explanation: "Incorrect. Impediments to progress are only one of the three topics that should be discussed at any standup meeting. Not only focusing on the impediments is insufficient, but having the project manager leading the meeting and reprimanding the team members for slow progress is not an agile best practice."}
            ], userAnswer: "D. Advise the project manager to only focus on impediments to progress", correctAnswer: "C. Have a team member to facilitate the standup instead of the project manager", explanation: "Agile leaders are not only responsible for understanding the guidelines governing the daily standup meeting but also for ensuring that all team members adhere to these guidelines. In this situation, the project manager does not follow these guidelines by allowing the meeting to go over the 15-minute time-box as well as reprimanding the team members for slow progress thus forcing the daily standup to become a traditional status meeting. Those who have mainly worked in a predictive environment may tend to fall into this anti-pattern since they used to get a status from the team members. To ensure that the next daily standup meeting does not fall into this trap, the agile practitioner should encourage the team members to facilitate the standup instead of the project manager so that the meeting is used as a time for the team to self-organize and make commitments to each other.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 2, text: "An agile coach is explaining to the product owner that implementing agile best practices on his projects will offer many benefits, such as timeboxing, which helps to mitigate the effects of Parkinson’s Law. Which of the following describes Parkinson’s Law?", options: [
                {text: "A. Waiting until the last minute to start a task that was planned weeks before", explanation: "Incorrect. This choice contains a description of Student Syndrome, or procrastination, which occurs when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline."},
                {text: "B. When assigned tasks interrupt each other, and they need to be worked on simultaneously", explanation: "Incorrect. This choice describes multitasking, which occurs when switching between tasks during project work. Multitasking reduces the throughput of the team’s work and impacts the team’s ability to predict delivery consistently."},
                {text: "C. When transferring work that is finished earlier than expected, is delayed because the next process or team member is not ready to accept it", explanation: "Incorrect. This choice describes 'no early work transfers', which occurs when a team member delays transferring work to the next team member when tasks are completed earlier than expected."},
                {text: "D. When tasks expand to fill the time that has been allocated to complete them", explanation: "Correct. This choice describes Parkinson’s Law, which states that work tends to expand to fill the time allocated to complete the work."}
            ], userAnswer: "C. When transferring work that is finished earlier than expected, is delayed because the next process or team member is not ready to accept it", correctAnswer: "D. When tasks expand to fill the time that has been allocated to complete them", explanation: "Parkinson’s Law states that work tends to expand to fill the time available or allocated to complete the work. Agile best practices help to mitigate the effects of Parkinson’s Law because they focus on short timeboxes to complete the work, and therefore enable project team members to be more focused on getting the work done within the time allocated.", domain: "Domain I: Mindset", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 7, text: "A two-year project to create a state-of-the-art drivetrain for the latest model of a global automobile production company has just come to an end. The team is engaged in the final project closeout activities. Which of the following might be included in these activities?", options: [
                {text: "A. Conducting a kick-off meeting to celebrate the successful completion of the project", explanation: "An end-of-project celebration is part of project closure, but the kick-off meeting should be held at the start of the project."},
                {text: "B. Project closure is not performed on an agile project as it does not produce value for the customer", explanation: "Project closure is still necessary for an agile project. Activities during project closure may include but are not limited to handing over the product, finishing up any loose ends, project review, celebrating, and releasing resources."},
                {text: "C. Release of the final product to the operations team", explanation: "Projects, by definition, are temporary endeavors and the project team eventually needs to release the product to the operations team. The release of the final product is an essential component of project closure."},
                {text: "D. Preparing the project definition of done", explanation: "The project definition of done should have been prepared very early on in the project, not at the end of the project."}
            ], userAnswer: "D. Preparing the project definition of done", correctAnswer: "C. Release of the final product to the operations team", explanation: "Activities during project closure may include but are not limited to handing over the product, finishing up any loose ends, project review, celebrating, and releasing resources. The release of the final product is an essential component of project closure.", domain: "Domain IV: Delivery", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 11, text: "An experienced software developer is working with a less experienced developer in a pair programming setup. What should the more experienced developer say to the less experienced developer to best explain continuous integration?", options: [
                {text: "A. The code is reviewed, line by line, by the more experienced partner in a pair programming setup and rewritten prior to being entered into the control system.", explanation: "Incorrect. Pair programming is a core principle of Extreme Programming (XP) but is not considered part of the continuous integration process."},
                {text: "B. The code is compiled in the control system at the end of the iteration, where it undergoes quality testing by the quality assurance team prior to the next iteration.", explanation: "Incorrect. Under continuous integration, one would not wait until the end of an iteration to compile and test the code."},
                {text: "C. Small batches of the code are checked in, a build is initiated by the control system, automated tests are run, and the developer is notified electronically of any errors.", explanation: "Correct. This choice has the correct explanation of continuous integration."},
                {text: "D. The code is compiled in the control system at the end of a release and then tested just before the release date approaches at the 'last responsible moment'.", explanation: "Incorrect. Under continuous integration, one should not wait until the end of a release to compile and test the code."}
            ], userAnswer: "B. The code is compiled in the control system at the end of the iteration, where it undergoes quality testing by the quality assurance team prior to the next iteration.", correctAnswer: "C. Small batches of the code are checked in, a build is initiated by the control system, automated tests are run, and the developer is notified electronically of any errors.", explanation: "Continuous integration is one of the core practices of the eXtreme Programming (XP) agile product development method, where XP teams integrate at least daily. After a developer completes a small change to the code, they check the changed code into the control system, where a process notices the change and initiates a full build. When the build is complete, a suite of automated tests is run. If any of the tests fail, the developer is notified about the failure, so they can take the appropriate action. One of the benefits of continuous integration is that integration problems are fixed one at a time in extremely small batches, as soon as they occur.", domain: "Domain III: Product", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 16, text: "An agile team created a Kanban board containing five columns. One of the software developers is determining the work in process (WIP) limit for each column to optimize the team’s performance. What should the agile team consider when determining an appropriate WIP limit for each column?", options: [
                {text: "A. The limit, if set incorrectly, can cause either people or work to be idle.", explanation: "Correct. If the WIP limit is set too high, then work will become idle. Conversely, if the WIP limit is too low, then some people will not have any available work."},
                {text: "B. The WIP limit should be removed for larger projects.", explanation: "Incorrect. The WIP limit is essential for optimizing performance, regardless of project size. Removing it could lead to inefficiencies and bottlenecks."},
                {text: "C. The WIP limit should be set based on the team's velocity.", explanation: "Incorrect. Velocity is a measure of throughput in Scrum, but in Kanban, WIP limits are determined based on capacity and flow, not velocity."},
                {text: "D. The WIP limit should be the same for all columns.", explanation: "Incorrect. WIP limits should be tailored to each column's capacity and the nature of the work in that stage to optimize flow."}
            ], userAnswer: "D. The WIP limit should be the same for all columns.", correctAnswer: "A. The limit, if set incorrectly, can cause either people or work to be idle.", explanation: "When determining WIP limits, the team must consider the potential for idle work or people if limits are set incorrectly, which can hinder performance.", domain: "Domain IV: Delivery", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 232, text: "An agile practitioner has to follow a lot of rules and guidelines, which at times becomes overwhelming. As time goes by, the practitioner becomes more experienced in deciding on which rules fit each situation, thus making the practitioner feel more personally responsible for the choices they make. Which stage in the Dreyfus model of adult skill acquisition has the practitioner reached?", options: [
                {text: "A. Novice", explanation: "Incorrect. Novice is the first stage of the Dreyfus Model. During this stage, novices understand and follow the rules and guidelines that have been communicated to them."},
                {text: "B. Proficient", explanation: "Incorrect. Proficient is the fourth stage of the Dreyfus model. During this stage, a person's decision making is still analytical, but they are actively choosing the best strategy to follow rather than simply relying on the rules and guidelines that have been communicated to them."},
                {text: "C. Advanced beginner", explanation: "Incorrect. Advanced beginner is the second stage of the Dreyfus model. During this stage, an individual still follows the rules and the guidelines and makes analytical decisions. However, now the person has gained enough experience with real-world situations to begin to understand the context of the rules and the guidelines."},
                {text: "D. Competent", explanation: "Correct. Competent is the third stage of the Dreyfus model. At this stage, an agile practitioner understands that a number of rules and guidelines they need to follow sometimes becomes overwhelming, so the practitioner is becoming experienced in deciding which rules best fit each individual situation."}
            ], userAnswer: "B. Proficient", correctAnswer: "D. Competent", explanation: "The Dreyfus model of adult skill acquisition outlines the progression of skill development in individuals. In this scenario, the agile practitioner demonstrates an understanding of when to apply specific rules, indicating they have reached the competent stage.", domain: "Domain I: Mindset", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 238, text: "During a meeting to make decisions about project goals and product features, it was observed that some project stakeholders did not express whether they were for or against the inclusion of particular goals for their agile project. Which of the following tools could be used to help elicit a response from all participants in order to help ensure a productive discussion?", options: [
                {text: "A. Convergence", explanation: "Incorrect. Convergence or collective agreement is a goal for making decisions, so there is collective buy-in and team support for the decision made. Convergence is an aim or goal of participatory decisions facing agile teams and it is not a tool that is used to ensure all participants express their opinions."},
                {text: "B. Rolling wave planning", explanation: "Incorrect. Rolling wave planning is a technique used in project management to allow a project to be planned in increments and iterations over time. Rolling wave planning is not a specific tool or technique used to facilitate decision making."},
                {text: "C. Story points", explanation: "Incorrect. Using story points is a tool used to estimate features or user stories. Although assigning story points could be used to rank the goals or objectives of the project, it is not a decision-making tool and would not be appropriate or effective in this situation."},
                {text: "D. Decision spectrum", explanation: "Correct. A decision spectrum that includes responses other than simply 'yes' or 'no' allows each stakeholder to participate in the decision and render an opinion."}

Decision spectrum", explanation: "In this scenario, the use of a decision spectrum allows for a broader range of participant responses, facilitating a more inclusive and effective decision-making process. It helps to identify the level of support or concern each stakeholder has regarding the goals discussed.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 230, text: "Which of the following would be the most helpful in creating a collaborative work environment?", options: [
                {text: "A. Physical colocation", explanation: "Correct. Physical colocation, when possible, is one of the most effective ways to create a collaborative work environment. Physical colocation enables the face-to-face interaction among the team members, which contributes to a collaborative work environment."},
                {text: "B. Caves and common", explanation: "Incorrect. ‘Caves and common’ is an agile term describing the team's physical space arrangement with a large area called ‘common’ where the team members work together most of the time, and private spaces called ‘caves’ where individual team members can ‘escape’ for short periods of time to work in a quiet environment. While the ‘caves and common’ space arrangement is helpful in creating a collaborative work environment, it is a specific case of and is enabled by physical colocation, and not the vice versa. Therefore, ‘caves and common’ is not the best answer."},
                {text: "C. Tacit knowledge", explanation: "Incorrect. Tacit knowledge is the undocumented information that is collectively known by a group of people. Tacit knowledge is enabled by physical colocation and it is a result rather than a cause of a collaborative work environment."},
                {text: "D. Cultural diversity", explanation: "Incorrect. Cultural diversity is often an impediment to maximum collaboration between agile team members but can normally be handled effectively. If a conscious effort is made to compromise and understand the cultural differences of team members from different cultures, it will help them embrace behaviors such as transparency and the ability for them to collaborate openly, even if these behaviors are not natural to them."}
            ], userAnswer: "D. Cultural diversity", correctAnswer: "A. Physical colocation", explanation: "Collaboration among team members is one of the key elements of successful projects. Among the choices given, physical colocation is the most effective way to create a collaborative work environment with caves and common and allows face-to-face communication among the team members, which, if implemented properly, help build tacit knowledge, enables osmotic communication, and allows team members to more effectively apply agile best practices.", domain: "Domain I: Mindset", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },

                {text: "A. Kanban board", explanation: "While a Kanban board shows work items in different stages, it does not provide the same level of detail needed to analyze bottlenecks effectively across the entire process. Thus, it is not the best choice for this specific requirement."},
                {text: "B. Release burndown chart", explanation: "A release burndown chart is primarily used for tracking progress towards completion of a release, but it does not provide insights into work in progress or bottlenecks, making it unsuitable for this analysis."},
                {text: "C. Control chart", explanation: "Control charts focus on individual metrics over time rather than providing a comprehensive view of multiple stages of work. This limitation means it would not effectively help the team analyze their overall process for bottlenecks."},
