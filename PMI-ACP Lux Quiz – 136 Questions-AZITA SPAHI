        const questions = [
            { id: 4, text: "How should an agile project leader interact with the product owner?", options: [
                {text: "A. Conduct regular one-on-one meetings to review development features and trace them back to the product roadmap.", explanation: "While regular one-on-one meetings can be beneficial, they do not fully leverage the collaborative nature of agile methodologies. These meetings focus more on individual interactions rather than team-wide communication and continuous feedback, which are crucial for agile success."},
                {text: "B. Ensure that they attend regular sprint meetings to provide product-feature feedback.", explanation: "Regular sprint meetings, such as sprint reviews and sprint planning, are essential in agile frameworks. Having the product owner attend these meetings ensures that they can provide immediate feedback on the product features, prioritize the backlog based on the latest insights, and ensure alignment with the product vision. This approach promotes transparency, collaboration, and iterative improvement, which are key principles of agile."},
                {text: "C. Share any new versions of the project plan with them, including updated statuses for tasks and project milestones.", explanation: "Agile methodologies focus more on adaptive planning and less on maintaining detailed project plans and milestones. Sharing updated project plans and statuses is more aligned with traditional project management approaches and does not emphasize the iterative and flexible nature of agile practices."},
                {text: "D. Schedule meetings where they can provide team direction regarding new-feature priorities and upcoming sprints.", explanation: "While scheduling specific meetings for priority discussions can be useful, it is more efficient and effective to incorporate these discussions into existing agile ceremonies, such as sprint planning and backlog grooming sessions. This ensures continuous feedback and avoids unnecessary additional meetings."}
            ], userAnswer: "A. Conduct regular one-on-one meetings to review development features and trace them back to the product roadmap.", correctAnswer: "B. Ensure that they attend regular sprint meetings to provide product-feature feedback.", explanation: "In conclusion, ensuring that the product owner attends regular sprint meetings to provide product-feature feedback (Option B) is the best approach. This method aligns with agile principles by promoting ongoing communication, collaboration, and adaptability, ensuring that the product development stays aligned with the product vision and stakeholder needs.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 5, text: "A company is moving into a new space and is determining the best configuration for offices. The management team is also considering moving to an agile process. What advice should an agilist give?", options: [
                {text: "A. Arrange the office space to allow co-location of development teams and centrally located information radiators", explanation: "Co-location of development teams promotes face-to-face communication, which is a key principle in agile methodologies. It enhances collaboration, quick decision-making, and fosters a stronger team dynamic. Centrally located information radiators, such as task boards or dashboards, provide transparency and immediate access to project status and metrics, keeping everyone informed and aligned."},
                {text: "B. Isolate each development team to reduce all outside distractions", explanation: "Isolation goes against the collaborative nature of agile practices. Agile teams benefit from open communication and interaction, which helps in quickly addressing issues, sharing knowledge, and fostering innovation. Reducing distractions is important, but it should not come at the cost of isolation."},
                {text: "C. Ensure management understands the need for isolation to allow for concentration", explanation: "While concentration is important, the agile approach emphasizes collaboration and communication. Agile practices rely on team members working closely together, often in shared spaces, to enhance collaboration and flexibility. Isolation can hinder the spontaneous interactions and quick feedback loops that are crucial in agile environments."},
                {text: "D. Define the agile method the company will be using, and implement the office configuration based upon that method", explanation: "While defining the agile method is important, it should not solely determine the office configuration. The primary focus should be on creating an environment that supports collaboration and communication, which are fundamental to all agile methodologies. Co-location and information radiators are generally beneficial regardless of the specific agile method chosen."}
            ], userAnswer: "D. Define the agile method the company will be using, and implement the office configuration based upon that method", correctAnswer: "A. Arrange the office space to allow co-location of development teams and centrally located information radiators", explanation: "In the context of agile methodologies, the physical workspace plays a critical role in fostering effective collaboration, communication, and transparency. The best practice is to arrange office spaces that facilitate co-location of development teams and include centrally located information radiators. This setup enhances team dynamics and allows for immediate access to project information, which is vital for agile success. The other options, while they may seem to address certain concerns, ultimately contradict the core principles of agile by promoting isolation and limiting collaboration.", domain: "Domain I: Mindset", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 8, text: "A project team identifies a number of technical challenges with features in the next sprint. What should they do?", options: [
                {text: "A. Request direction from the technical manager", explanation: "While seeking advice from the technical manager might provide some guidance, it does not leverage the team's collective expertise to solve the challenges. Agile teams are self-organizing and should first try to address issues internally before escalating."},
                {text: "B. Encourage the product owner to reallocate the features to another sprint", explanation: "Simply reallocating the features to another sprint does not address the technical challenges and could lead to further delays. It is important to confront and resolve the issues to ensure smooth progress in future sprints."},
                {text: "C. Determine who is best qualified to address the challenges", explanation: "This approach utilizes the team’s strengths and expertise to tackle the technical challenges. By identifying who is best qualified, the team can effectively address the issues and ensure that the sprint goals are met. This approach aligns with agile principles of self-organization and collaboration."},
                {text: "D. Ask the product owner to assign the tasks to the most appropriately skilled resources", explanation: "The product owner is primarily responsible for prioritizing the backlog and ensuring that the team delivers value. Assigning tasks to specific team members based on skill sets should be a team decision, fostering self-organization and ownership among the team members."}
            ], userAnswer: "A. Request direction from the technical manager", correctAnswer: "C. Determine who is best qualified to address the challenges", explanation: "Determining who is best qualified to address the challenges (Option C) is the best approach. This leverages the team’s expertise and fosters a collaborative, self-organizing environment, enabling the team to effectively tackle technical challenges and continue progressing towards their goals. Agile principles emphasize the importance of self-organization and collaboration, making it essential for teams to address challenges collectively rather than relying on external direction.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 10, text: "How can an agile team working on a new product ensure alignment with external stakeholders?", options: [
                {text: "A. Ask the product owner to provide a detailed product specification document", explanation: "While detailed product specifications can provide clarity, they are not typically aligned with agile principles, which favor just-in-time documentation and adaptability. Over-reliance on detailed documentation can stifle flexibility and responsiveness to change."},
                {text: "B. Conduct story-mapping exercises to clarify deliverables and release priorities", explanation: "Story mapping is an effective agile technique that helps teams visualize the product backlog and prioritize work based on user needs and business value. This exercise involves stakeholders in the process, ensuring that their expectations and priorities are clearly understood and aligned with the team's work. It promotes collaboration and continuous feedback, which are essential for maintaining alignment in an agile environment."},
                {text: "C. Hold a kick-off meeting to assign roles and responsibilities", explanation: "While a kick-off meeting is important for setting initial expectations and assigning roles, it does not ensure ongoing alignment with external stakeholders. Agile teams need continuous interaction and feedback from stakeholders to remain aligned with their needs and priorities."},
                {text: "D. Work with the scrum master and stakeholders to ensure agile principles are followed", explanation: "Ensuring that agile principles are followed is important, but it does not directly address the need for alignment with external stakeholders. The focus should be on engaging stakeholders in the process and understanding their priorities and feedback."}
            ], userAnswer: "D. Work with the scrum master and stakeholders to ensure agile principles are followed", correctAnswer: "B. Conduct story-mapping exercises to clarify deliverables and release priorities", explanation: "Conducting story-mapping exercises to clarify deliverables and release priorities is the best approach for ensuring alignment with external stakeholders. This method actively involves stakeholders in the planning process, ensuring that their needs and priorities are clearly understood and incorporated into the team's work. This promotes alignment, collaboration, and continuous feedback, which are essential for successful agile project management.", domain: "Domain III: Product", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 11, text: "A product owner complains that some of the requirements identified several iterations ago have not been implemented. The product owner wants to know why the status of these requirements was not communicated. What should the Scrum Master do?", options: [
                {text: "A. Point out that the team chose to work on other requirements to speed up the project", explanation: "This response might come across as defensive and does not address the communication issue raised by the product owner. It fails to provide a constructive solution for improving transparency and communication."},
                {text: "B. Ensure that the product owner reviews the contents of the information radiator", explanation: "Information radiators, such as task boards or burndown charts, are designed to provide real-time visibility into the status of the project. Ensuring that the product owner regularly reviews these tools helps maintain transparency and keeps everyone informed about the progress and priorities. This approach fosters better communication and collaboration, effectively addressing the product owner's concerns."},
                {text: "C. Ensure that the next sprint planning meeting reviews the satisfaction histogram", explanation: "While reviewing the satisfaction histogram can provide insights into team satisfaction and areas for improvement, it does not directly address the issue of communicating the status of specific requirements. The focus should be on improving ongoing communication and visibility."},
                {text: "D. Point out that it is the responsibility of the product owner to clarify requirements", explanation: "Although it is true that the product owner should clarify requirements, it does not address the core issue of communication and status updates. This option places the blame on the product owner rather than offering a solution to improve transparency and collaboration."}
            ], userAnswer: "C. Ensure that the next sprint planning meeting reviews the satisfaction histogram", correctAnswer: "B. Ensure that the product owner reviews the contents of the information radiator", explanation: "Information radiators are designed to provide real-time visibility into the status of the project. Ensuring that the product owner regularly reviews these tools helps maintain transparency and keeps everyone informed about the progress and priorities. This approach fosters better communication and collaboration, effectively addressing the product owner's concerns.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 23, text: "A new team is reluctant to provide estimates at the first backlog refinement meeting. What should the agile practitioner tell the team about agile estimating?", options: [
                {text: "A. Agile estimates are more accurate.", explanation: "Estimates are not necessarily more accurate, and even though they are helpful, they are approximations and not completely accurate."},
                {text: "B. Agile estimates provide clarity and are updated as needed.", explanation: "Agile projects use relative estimates that are updated for accuracy throughout the project life cycle. A continuous updating process ensures that estimates remain relevant and reflect the current state of the project."},
                {text: "C. Agile estimates are firm commitments.", explanation: "An estimate does not represent a firm commitment, but an approach."},
                {text: "D. Agile estimates determine the business value of a user story.", explanation: "Business value is an iterative process, and therefore it will be recalled throughout project rollout."}
            ], userAnswer: "A. Agile estimates are more accurate.", correctAnswer: "B. Agile estimates provide clarity and are updated as needed.", explanation: "Agile estimating is a flexible process that involves ongoing updates to ensure relevance and accuracy, which helps the team understand the project's status better.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 28, text: "Executives have conflicting opinions on a project’s status. What should the agile practitioner do?", options: [
                {text: "A. Add a task to generate an executive summary.", explanation: "Adding a task to generate an executive summary will not resolve the issue of conflicting opinions regarding the project status."},
                {text: "B. Send the executives a copy of the project burndown chart.", explanation: "Sending the executives a burndown chart would not meet the requirement because a burndown chart shows progress against remaining work, but might not provide the full context needed to understand conflicting opinions about project status."},
                {text: "C. Add a recurring status meeting to the review process.", explanation: "Adding a recurring status meeting could increase overhead and may not immediately resolve conflicting opinions if the underlying conflicts are not addressed effectively."},
                {text: "D. Post the project's status on the enterprise project dashboard.", explanation: "This option is the most viable, as the executives can look at the Executive Dashboard and read the same report that was loaded by the project team. An agile practitioner should discuss and arrive at a consensus on the format of the project status report. Then the project report must be periodically updated at a shared location. This would avoid multiple versions of the reports being shared within the company. The best option would be to post the project status on the enterprise dashboard."}
            ], userAnswer: "B. Send the executives a copy of the project burndown chart.", correctAnswer: "D. Post the project's status on the enterprise project dashboard.", explanation: "The correct response focuses on creating transparency and ensuring all stakeholders have access to the same information. This is crucial in Agile environments where collaboration and shared understanding are key to resolving conflicts.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 29, text: "During a daily coordination meeting, an agile practitioner learns that one user story is incomplete because team members were unable to agree on an approach. What should the agile practitioner do?", options: [
                {text: "A. Meet with the manager to determine the best approach.", explanation: "Meeting with the manager might undermine the team’s autonomy and decision-making process, which is essential for fostering team ownership and collaboration."},
                {text: "B. Encourage the team to reach an agreement on the approach.", explanation: "Encouraging the team to reach an agreement promotes collaboration and leverages the collective expertise of the team, aligning with agile principles of self-organization."},
                {text: "C. Request that the team leader choose the best approach.", explanation: "Requesting that the team leader choose the approach can bypass the team’s collective knowledge and insights. Agile emphasizes team collaboration and consensus-building, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions."},
                {text: "D. Ask for an explanation of each approach and choose the best one.", explanation: "Asking for an explanation of each approach and choosing the best one is not suitable for the role of an agile practitioner, as it undermines the team's self-organizing capabilities and may lead to a lack of ownership among team members."}
            ], userAnswer: "C. Request that the team leader choose the best approach.", correctAnswer: "B. Encourage the team to reach an agreement on the approach.", explanation: "The agile practitioner should encourage the team to reach an agreement on the approach to promote collaboration and leverage the collective expertise of the team.", domain: "Domain II: Leadership", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 206, text: "Following the release of a project that followed agile management practices, the team realized they did not meet the customer’s expectations. What should have been done to avoid this?", options: [
                {text: "A. The customer should have actively participated in all iteration planning activities.", explanation: "Although customer involvement is crucial, relying solely on their participation in planning meetings does not guarantee a thorough understanding or alignment of long-term project goals."},
                {text: "B. The project team should have requested continuous feedback during the iteration.", explanation: "Without a structured process or the involvement of the product owner, continuous feedback might not be effectively integrated into the product backlog or aligned with strategic priorities."},
                {text: "C. The project team should have collaborated with the product owner during initial release planning.", explanation: "Initial planning alone is insufficient for maintaining alignment throughout an agile project, where flexibility and iterative refinement are key to meeting evolving customer expectations."},
                {text: "D. The product owner should have continuously collaborated with the team to refine the product backlog.", explanation: "The product owner should have collaborated with the project team to refine the product backlog ensuring that the customer’s priorities and expectations are continuously aligned with the development efforts. This ensures that backlog items are well-defined, prioritized, and aligned with customer needs and expectations."}
            ], userAnswer: "C. The project team should have collaborated with the product owner during initial release planning.", correctAnswer: "D. The product owner should have continuously collaborated with the team to refine the product backlog.", explanation: "The product owner should have collaborated with the project team to refine the product backlog ensuring that the customer’s priorities and expectations are continuously aligned with the development efforts. This ensures that backlog items are well-defined, prioritized, and aligned with customer needs and expectations.", domain: "Domain III: Product", category: "B", isNewFormat: true },
            { id: 216, text: "An agile team is working on a project within a heavily regulated organization. The team is using an iterative approach but needs to follow the organization’s specific processes. How should the agile practitioner plan for the release with these organizational processes?", options: [
                {text: "A. Work within the constraints of the organizational processes to deliver the project.", explanation: "This option showcases the adaptive nature of the agile approach. Agile practices are inherently flexible and can be adapted to work within various organizational contexts, including controlled environments. By aligning agile practices with the organization’s processes, the agile practitioner ensures that both agile values and organizational requirements are addressed."},
